    "Defining multiple projects, may be convenient to use different databases, configurations and python environments when working on different topics or with different sofwares. When creating a second project, the most convenient option would be to copy a previous one and make the minor changes likely required. To better understand each section here we will instead start from an empty configuration.\n",

In this tutorial two different stores needs to be provided because Atomate2 uses two database collections, one for small documents (such as elastic tensors, structures, and energies) called the docs store and another for large documents such as band structures and density of states called the data store.\n",

    "Due to inherent limitations in MongoDB (individual documents cannot be larger than 16 Mb), here GridFS is used to store large data. GridFS sits on top of MongoDB and the configuration is thus equivalent to the one from the docs store (note that two different collection names need to be provided). However, GridFS space may be expensive if you rely on cloud services, so other storage types are available and may be more convenient (e.g. Amazon S3 or Azure Blob).\n",
